# passport-authentication-node

Hi folks, its been a while since I finished the mini-reddit project and for about two weeks I taught myself server programming using node.js. In this project, I'd like to applied what I have learned which to create an authentication flow using a simple combo of username-password with help of passport.js library.

Here are some new things that I have learned so far:
 
* event-loop nature which allows [node.js]() to perform non-blocking I/O operations even though javascript is a single-threaded language.
* [express.js]() as routing and middleware framework.
* [morgan]() as request(s) logger.
* [body-parser]() as body parser.
* [cors]() to enable cors.
* cookies and sessions.
* [express-session]() to manage sessions.
* [passport.js]() to handle authentication and authorization.
* [bcrypt]() to hash user's password before inserting into database.
* security-related HTTP Headers and how they can play an important role by preventing common web attacks such as clickjacking & cross-site scripting (XSS).


This project is meant to be an experimental and demonstration purposes, therefore it won't be deployed and to use it I also created the client-side web app using react. I think that's pretty much it and I will try to update when I have done with the project. Peace!
